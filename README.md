# CatBoost-Road-Accident-2015
A data science collaborative project on Road accidents in UK, 2015  - CatBoost Team

## Problem statement: 
A safe road system aims to eliminate fatal and serious injuries for all road users. It does so through a holistic view of the road system that first anticipates human mistakes and second keeps impact energy on the human body at tolerable levels. Safety is imperative of the designers and owners of the transportation system.

Making a commitment to zero deaths means addressing every aspect of accident risks through five elements which include safe road users, safe vehicles, safe speeds, safe roads, post-crash care.

The key focus of a safe system is to reduce death and serious injuries through design that accommodates human mistakes and injury tolerance.

However, the United Kingdom road safety deviates from the ideal safe road system. By less consideration of the five elements, UK records high number of accident cases which cause serious injuries on road users.

This inefficiency of the United Kingdom road safety system is clearly seen in 2015 where there was a total of 140,056 accident cases affecting over 180,000 persons with slight to fatal injuries. This means that on an average there was 15,000 casualties in a month. This claim is based on the UK_Traffic_Accidents_2015.csv data.

The aim of this project is to understand the major factors that contributed to road accidents in UK. One needs to know when, where, and why they happen.
